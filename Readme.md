# Bash Spanish Quiz

Usage:
* Make sure you have nodejs >=8 installed
* Clone the repository to somewhere on your machine, let's say at `~/mydir/bash-lang-quiz`
* Run `npm i` inside of `~/mydir/bash-lang-quiz`
* Then, at the very end of your `~/.bashrc` file, write `nodejs ~/mydir/bash-lang-quiz`

Now, every time you open up a new terminal window or bash instance, you will be prompted with a random Spanish (or language of your choice) headline to translate.
After you finish, this program will print out Google's translation and ask you if you were correct or not.
You can press `ctrl+c` at any time to break out directly to bash.
